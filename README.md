Everyone knows that spammers are smart enough to avoid the owner of the server, and Alphanus plans to help you with that. When Alphanus recieves a DM, The program will instantaniously ban the user, and log it.

# Grumpy!
Discord has completely banned Selfbots, and this self-bot was created in 2018.
It uses V6. You *will* be banned for using this, as it's almost certain that you'll be fully banned.
Although Alphanus was made with good intentions, it's fully against TOS.

## Install

pip install -U configparser discord.py requests raven
